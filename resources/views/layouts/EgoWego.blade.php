Blocked Users will not be able to

Get on camera in the video chat of the user who blocked them

Access the main chat of the user who blocked them In wording, blocked users can still access the video chat room of the user who blocked them but can't get on camera or chat to other users in the video chat room except through private messages. Whereas banned users can only use powers against the user who banned them

          (Assistant) ranking by order 1 - 3 where 3 can block rank 1 and rank 2 A video chat room owner can assign users as assistants to them in the room to help them block users who violates the rules, terms and conditions of EGOWEGO while being on camera. Examples are: nudity and using abusive language or engaging in political and religion discussions or showing violence scenes Assistants are ranked by levels 1 - 5 and assistants ranked level 5 can still block assistants ranked level 4 and bellow. The same goes for assistants ranked level 4, they can block assistants of level 3 and below. Generally speaking, assistants can block other users in the video chat room and as well assistants who are ranked by a level lower than them. Assistants can't ban users and assistants.
